Major findings came from the CDC website, Google Finance, InvestorPlace, Barrons, Raging Bull, Wall Street Survivor, SwingTradeBot, Benzinga, and MarketWatch. With the CDC Website, it gave accurate information as well as CSV data files on the number of cases, and number of cases per state. Also gave us information on the different type of cases(negative/positive and death/recovery). Initially this data was very hard to find, which took us more than a week to pull data on Covid cases.
With Google Finance, we were able to find stock prices on various industries to create CSV files and read them in to our Jupyter Notebook. We used this data to determine the impact that Covid had on stock prices in a timeline.

With the sports industry, it was difficult to track because of the absence of publicly traded stocks from sport's organizations such as the NFL. However, there are many companies that correlate with these private entities because of the investments that they have in them. For example, DIS and CMCSA are highly correlated with the NFL because of cable football and Disney's ownership of ESPN. By pulling stocks with companies that would normally have an increase in stock prices during sporting events, we were able to show how Covid also impacted their stock numbers during the pandemic. Industries like airlines, hospitality, and sports saw a significant drop in stock prices when the country went into lockdown. As a result, there was a decrease in revenue since sport fans were unable to attend games.

On the other hand, companies developing Covid vaccines and testing kits have seen an increase in their stock prices. For example, Novavax jumped in price due to the investment of their vaccine. Other companies such as Pfizer and Moderna also saw an increase as their vaccines were proven to be 95% effective. Abbott Laboratories experienced a minor decline but increased again as they focused on Covid testing kits. 

Over the course of the year, some companies saw an increase in their stocks while others did not. Overall, Covid-19 has hurt all industries and has shift the way we operate to ensure the safety of ourselves and others around us. The virus has caused us to be more thorough with cleanliness, and how we spread germs. Hopefully with a vaccine, these company stock prices will rebound as people will return to life as we call normal. So we ask ourselve these questions:

1.     What are the number of cases in America over time? We wanted to show how the cases went from a min to America leading in number of cases across the world
2.     Did the virus have an impact on each state? We want to show the correlation on the total amount of cases and which states were leading in total numbers.
3.     What was the impact to the travel, hospitality, & sports industries? We want to show that major industries also took a hit in stock prices during the shutdown and the correlation of what their stock look in the present.
4.     At any point of the year did number start to decrease? The stocks and cases all tied together and if the cases decreased, did stocks increase for those industries.
5.     What impact does COVID have on the pharmaceutical industryâ€™s stocks? We want to show how certain pharm stocks fared due to the news of a vaccine
